## Additional notes

There is a script folder where helper bash scripts are defined for formatting and linting the code base.
All codebase was formatted using black, flake8 and isort.

In order to run it manually:

`./scripts/check_coding.sh`

This action was defined as pre-commit hook, at each commit it will reformat your code base.
For activating pre-commit run locally:

`pre-commit install`

In each commit, the code base will nicely be formatted.
